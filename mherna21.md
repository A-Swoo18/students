# Background 

From 2019 to 2021, I took a few Java tutorials on YouTube and enrolled in three SheCodes Coding Bootcamps. The SheCodes journey was a rewarding experience that strengthened my aspiration to study Computer Science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK). One of my goals during my academic journey at UTK is not only to get As in my courses but fully understand all the topics covered in each of them. Additionally, to become a competent and valuable programmer, I always seek to expand my knowledge beyond the content covered in my classes. To this end, I have taken several online courses including a Udemy C++ course called "Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond," which furthered my knowledge of the C++ language. Also, I am currently enrolled in a Machine Learning online specialization on Coursera given by Andrew Ng and in two other online courses that teach the fundamentals of SQL and Linux.

My eagerness to learn and innovate led me to apply to two Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and to become an Undergraduate Research Assistant at UTK. During the Summer of 2022, I worked with the NordicLab researching the properties and applications of Hyper-FET transistors. We utilized the steep switching characteristics of this transistor to alleviate the charge leakage in dynamic logic circuits. Currently, I continue doing research under the supervision of Dr. Ahmedullah Aziz. This upcoming Fall, 2023 I will start using machine learning to develop algorithms that can learn and create statistical models to analyze databases of complex materials' structures and predict material properties. This past summer, 2023 I worked as a research intern at the University of Utah designing an Android malware classifier based on Convolutional Neural Networks and transformers, the latest is a major component of recent language models such as ChatGPT. 

In the fall of 2021, my cosc101 professor (Ms. Crumpton) noticed that I often assisted my cosc101 peers during office hours. This desire to help my classmates and my performance during the course drove Professor Crumpton to offer me a UTA position for cosc101, which I happily accepted. I worked as a TA from January 2022 to December 2022; thoroughly enjoying the job. Currently, I am a COSC202 UTA for Dr. Adam Disney. 

# Interests 

I feel deeply fascinated by many fields related to Computer Science. However, I'm focusing my attention lately on Machine Learning as mentioned previously.
